# Data Science Projects with Python

 This is a study project using the book Data Science Projects with Python. The objective of this project is to learn from real and problems how to solve them by Data Science. 

## [Project Business Problem](https://github.com/mh-pedro/Data-Science-Projects-with-Python/tree/main/1.%20Project%20Business%20Problem)

  **Description of problem:**
   The client is a credit card company and has brought a dataset that includes some demographics and recent finance data, over the past 6 months, for a sample of 30,000 of their account holders. This data is at the credit account level. The
   rows are labeled by whether, in the next month after the 6-month historical data period, an account owner has defaulted, or in other, words, failed to make the minimum payment.
   
   **Goal:**
   Your goal is to develop a predictive model for whether an account will default next month, given demographics and historical data.
   
   **Abilities**
   By the end of this first project, the abilities of pandas, the application of the correct use of data tabulation in Python, to do exploration in data analysis, quality assurance, and data cleaning were developed.
